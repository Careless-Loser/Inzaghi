# INZAGHI | Creative Technologist Portfolio

A cinematic, high-performance portfolio developed to showcase the intersection of systemic logic and digital craftsmanship. This project serves as a central hub for my work in Creative Computing, Freelance Web Development, and Visual Storytelling.

## 🧠 Philosophy: The Techno-Poet
This portfolio is built on the principle that code is an architecture of rules. Inspired by my background in **Legal Logic** and **Systems Thinking**, every interaction is designed to be intentional, minimalist, and immersive.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), Tailwind CSS
* **Animation:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) & ScrollTrigger
* **Motion:** Lenis (Smooth Scrolling)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Deployment:** Netlify / GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Cinematic UI:** Dark-themed aesthetic with a focus on typography and negative space.
* **Fluid Motion:** Kinetic scrolling and custom cursor interactions for a tactile feel.
* **Project Engine:** A dynamic `project-detail.js` system that injects data from a centralized `project-data.js` repository.
* **Mobile Responsive:** Optimized for all viewports, featuring a 90vh hero container and expanded mobile imagery.
* **Page Transitions:** Seamless GSAP-driven fade transitions between system nodes.
